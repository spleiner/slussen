## Features Explained

### Real-time Data

- **Update Frequency**: Automatic refresh every 60 seconds
- **Accuracy**: Shows real-time delays and cancellations

### Intelligent Stop Mapping

The application automatically shows the correct stop location based on the bus line:

**Glasbruksgatan Stop**:
- Line 25M (Market line to Marknadsplatsen)
- Line 26M (Market line to Gustavsberg)
- Line 423 (Local service)
- Line 449 (Local service)

### Priority-based Disruption Filtering

Not all service messages are shown - only high-priority disruptions that significantly affect service:

- **High Priority**: Major delays, route changes, service cancellations
- **Medium Priority**: Minor delays, crowding information
- **Low Priority**: Routine maintenance notices (filtered out)

### Departure Time Display

The application shows departure times in the most helpful format:

- **"2 min"**: Departing in 2 minutes
- **"14:35"**: Actual departure time (for longer waits)
- **"--"**: No real-time data available

## Tips and Tricks

### Efficient Usage

**For Daily Commuters**:
1. Filter to only your regular lines
2. Bookmark the filtered URL for quick access
3. Check disruptions first thing in the morning

**For Occasional Users**:
1. Keep "Alla bussar" selected to see all options
2. Check destination carefully (some lines have multiple variants)
3. Note the stop location to find the correct platform

### Mobile Usage

- **Responsive Design**: Works well on smartphones and tablets
- **Touch-friendly**: Large buttons and touch targets
- **Offline Tolerance**: Cached data available briefly if connection is lost

### Understanding Destinations

- **Nacka station**: Main transport hub in Nacka
- **V√§rmd√∂ centrum**: Shopping center in V√§rmd√∂

### Time Planning

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: How often is the data updated?**
A: The application fetches new data every 60 seconds automatically. You can also manually refresh by clicking "Uppdatera".

**Q: Why don't I see all bus lines to Nacka/V√§rmd√∂?**
A: The application only shows lines that regularly serve Nacka/V√§rmd√∂ destinations. Special services or infrequent lines may not be included.

**Q: Can I see buses going in the opposite direction?**
A: No, this application specifically shows buses FROM Slussen TO Nacka/V√§rmd√∂. For return journeys, use SL's official app.

**Q: What does "Glasbruksgatan" vs regular stops mean?**
A: Different bus lines depart from different locations around Slussen. The application automatically shows the correct stop for each line.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Does the app work offline?**
A: No, the app requires an internet connection to fetch real-time data from SL's APIs.

A: Times close to departure (usually within 30 minutes) are shown as "X min", while further departures show actual times like "14:35".

**Q: Is my location tracked?**
A: No, the application doesn't access or store any location data. It only shows departure information for the fixed Slussen stops.

### Data and Accuracy

**Q: How accurate are the departure times?**
A: Times come directly from SL's real-time systems and are generally accurate within 1-2 minutes, but delays can occur due to traffic or operational issues.
